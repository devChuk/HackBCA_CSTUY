<div class='centered' id='rules'><p>The goal of the game is to have end words that are the same as the beginning words.</br>
1.The game starts with four players in one room.</br>
2. Each player types any word they want. These are the beginning words.</br>
3. The words the players typed are passed around to another player.</br>
4. Each player must try to draw something that best represents the word they received within a time limit.</br>
5. After the time limit is over, the drawings are also passed around to a new player.</br>
6. Each player must type a word that best represents the drawing he receives</br>
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 two more times. The final words each player types are the end words.</br>
8. The screen will display the words and drawings in order of when they were created. This will show how the words and drawings “evolved” over time from the beginning words to the end words. In essence, this game is pictionary telephone.</br>
